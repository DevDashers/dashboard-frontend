### **Cooperation Plan**

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

| Team Member | Strengths | Competencies You Want to Develop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heather Holcomb | UI/UX, Product Mgmt, Design, backend | Front end - componentizing, nested components, state and props |
| Kaeden O'Meara | CSS, Back End | Back End, Styling |
| Ike Steoger | JavaScript & Back End | Front End & Styling |
| Donna Ada | CSS, Front End | Back End |

#### Day-to-Day Approach
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
- Daily stand up each morning, review & trello cards
- We'll sit in Remo together while code
- Review and push changes from Dev branch to Main as a group each day.

**NOTE**: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

### **Conflict Plan**

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

| Discussion | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| What will be your group's process to resolve conflict, when it arises? | Talk it out altogether like adults. |
| What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute? | Communicate and address as a team. |
| How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? | Help each other understand and come from a place of understanding. Screen share and run through challenges as a team. |
| How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? | Communication - addressing it head on. |
| How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? | Escalate to Audrey/JB to join in team discussion for resolution ASAP. Also, just don't be a jerk. |

### **Communication Plan**

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

| Communication Channels |

### **Work Plan**

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems. This should prevent "lone wolf" efforts and "siloed" efforts.

| Discussion | Answers |
| --- | --- |
| How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? | Review trello cards during stand ups - use built in Trello functionality to assign tasks and commit to keeping the board up to date. |
| What project management tool will be used? | Trello: [https://trello.com/b/0uHZMGVi/code301d98-group-project](https://trello.com/b/0uHZMGVi/code301d98-group-project) |

**NOTE** : While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks._

### **Presentation Deck**

Make a single copy of the [Presentation Deck Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NeXKKEpjK2DDme8EwlZBsJndUqIgGYzWrY6FAYtNTf0/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_3_31). Share your copy with all team members, so everyone is working from the same file.

| --- | --- |

#### **Schedule your practice session**

Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your "practice run" of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

| Practice Session | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Dry Run with Instructor | Thu May 4 @ 1:30pm PST |
| Final Run before Presentation | Fri May 5 @ 9:30am PST |
